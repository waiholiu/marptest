# What is this
An example of how to get a markdown file converted into a powerpoint

# What do i need to do?
Just make changes to the Test.md file. This is the markdown file that stores your presentation. Push to master - it'll kick off a Github action - when that finishes, it'll save the latest version of the latest PPTX file as an artefact
